# imaginary Fermi potential, diffuse reflectivity, spin flip probability, micro-roughness parameters, enable micro-roughness reflection, internal magnetic field
# Diffuse reflection is either modeled with a Lambert model (scattering angle cosine-distributed around surface normal),
#  a modified Lambert model (scattering angle cosine-distributed around specular-scattering vector), or the Micro Roughness model.
# To activate either Lambert model, set the (modified) Lambert-reflection probability. To activate micro roughness, set RMSroughness and CorrelationLength.
# See https://doi.org/10.1080/10448639208218770 and https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/n-lengths/

# When a neutron hits a surface, the code randomly chooses to flip its spin based on the given spin flip probability.
# Then it calculates the potential difference between the previous and the new material, taking into account the spin polarization and internal magnetic fields.
# Based on the potential difference and the diffuse-reflection parameters it chooses if the neutron should be transmitted or reflected specularly or diffusely.
