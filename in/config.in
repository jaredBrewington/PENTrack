[GEOMETRY]
############# Solids the program will load ################
#  Each solid has to be assigned unique ID and a material from above.
# IDs have to be larger than 0, ID 1 will be assumed to be the default medium which is always present.
# Particles absorbed in a solid will be flagged with the ID of the solid.
# The ID also defines the order in which overlapping solids are handled (highest ID will be considered first).
# If paths to StL files are relative they have to be defined relative to this config file.
# Ignore times are pairs of times [s] in between the solid will be ignored, e.g. 100-200 500-1000.

[SOURCE]
############ sourcemodes ###############
# STLvolume: source volume is given by a STL file, particles are created in the space completely enclosed in the STL surface
# boxvolume: particle starting values are diced in the given parameter range (x,y,z) [m,m,m]
# cylvolume: particle starting values are diced in the given parameter range (r,phi,z) [m,degree,m]
# Volume source produce velocity vectors according to the given angular distributions below.
# If PhaseSpaceWeighting is set to 1 for volume sources the energy spectrum is interpreted as a total-energy spectrum.
## The probability to find a particle at a certain initial position is then weighted by the available phase space,
## i.e. proportional to the square root of the particle's kinetic energy.
#
# STLsurface: starting values are on surfaces in the given STL-volume
# cylsurface: starting values are on surfaces in the cylindrical volume given by parameter range (r,phi,z) [m,degree,m]
# Surface sources produce velocity vectors cosine(theta)-distributed around the surface normal.
# An additional Enormal [eV] can be defined. This adds an additional energy boost to the velocity component normal to the surface.

[FIELDS]
########### electric and magnetic fields ##########
# Tabulated maps:
# OPERA2D: a table of field values on a regular 2D grid exported from OPERA. It is assumed that the field is rotationally symmetric around the z axis.
# OPERA3D: a table of field values on a rectilinear 3D grid exported from OPERA
# COMSOL: a generic 3D table of magnetic field values on a rectilinear grid, e.g. exported from COMSOL
# 2D and 3D tables allow to scale coordinates with a given factor. Scaled coordinates are assumed to be in meters.
# Scaled magnetic fields are assumed to be in Tesla, scaled electric potentials in V.
# For 3D tables a BoundaryWidth [m] can be specified within which the field is smoothly brought to zero.
# Paths of table files are assumed to be relative to this config file's path
#
# Analytically calculated fields:
# Conductor: simulate a current flowing from one point to another along an arbitrary straight line
# EDMStaticEField: simulate a uniform electric field along an arbitrary direction
# EDMStaticB0GradZField: simulate a magnetic field along the z-axis with a uniform gradient
# ExponentialFieldX: simulate magnetic field B = (a1 exp(-a2 x + a3) + c1, 1/2 y a1 a2 exp(-a2 x + a3) + c2, 1/2 z a1 a2 exp(-a2 x + a3) + c2) in a box
# LinearFieldZ: simulate magnetic field along z and linear in x: B = (0, 0, a1*x + a2) in a box
# All coordinates are defined in meters, currents in ampere, fields in Tesla
#
# Each line is preceded by a unique identifier. Entries with duplicate identifiers will overwrite each other
# For each field a time-dependent scaling factor can be added (does not allow spaces yet!).
# Note that rapidly changing fields might be missed by the trajectory integrator making too large time steps
